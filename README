CAEN VME utils
==============

Bunch of utilities for communicating with CAEN boards on VME.

The scheme is to have a VME bridge utility,
which wraps the CAEN lib calls on VME bridge
and provides a plain text protocl for them.
Plus implementations of TDC, General Purpose etc boards
(their registers etc, the datasheet)
in the VME plain text protocol.

The scheme looks like this:

     VME       |       VME bridge utility          |=
 plain text ---|            (process)              |= VME
  protocol     |                                   |= bus
 /             | [PCI board]--[optical-VME board]= |=
|
implementation of
TDC, General etc boards
in the plain text protocol
